Please refer the algorithm mentioned above, the solution is based on the above-mentioned algorithm. We have a general stopping criterion (E) is 0.005. Please follow the given steps below:<br />
We have <i>regula falsi method </i>to find the next approximation<br />

1. The first step is to find different sign values as follows:<br />

As you can observe, we have found the required values to proceed to further steps<br />
2.&nbsp;By taking &ldquo;x<sub>0</sub>=0&rdquo; and &ldquo;x<sub>1</sub>=2&rdquo; from the first step, the root lies between (x<sub>0,</sub>x<sub>1</sub>)<br />

<p>Please note: there are many methods to calculate the error, mostly&nbsp;we use the following techniques<br />
